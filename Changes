Revision history for Perl extension xPL.

0.06  Sat,  6 Oct 2007 21:53:37 +0100

	- New mailing lists: announce@xpl-perl.org.uk, dev@xpl-perl.org.uk
	- New client: xpl-ctx35 experimental (transmit only) support for
	  CTX35/TI103/TI203/TI213 X10 Transceiver.  Thanks to Eric-jan
	  Riemers for testing.
	- New client: xpl-sms-send.  More generic SMS sending using
	  SMS::Send drivers from CPAN.
	- Added to SMS::Send drivers one for CSoft (tested) and one for
	  SMSDiscount (untested since I don't have an account) both of
	  these will probably move to CPAN.
	- New script: xpl-tty-tcp make a serial/USB device available on
	  a TCP port.  Allows multiple clients to connect at once though
	  I don't recemmend it.  It is primarily intended to allow me
	  to emulate a networked RFXCom transmitter/receiver for testing
	  purposes.
	- RFXCom: Experimental transmitter support.
	- RFXCom: Several improvements to the receiver client.  Thanks
	  to Bert for his comments on the xpl-dev@xpl-home.org list on
	  Wed, 04 Jul 2007 12:30:53 -0400.
	- RFXCom: RFXSensor negative temperature support (untested).
	- RFXCom: Oregon THWR288A support.  Thanks to Eric-jan Riemers for
	  test data and testing.
	- RFXMeter/RFXPower: Bug fixing.  Thanks to Rick Klaassen.
	- RFXCom: Support for WGR918.  Thanks to Rick Klaassen for test
	  data, testing and bug fixing.
	- RFXCom: Visonic PowerCode and CodeSecure devices.  I'd still
	  like to implemente parity (or similar) checking for CodeSecure
	  device if such a thing is possible.
	- RFXCom: Support for networked (as well as USB) receivers and
	  transmitters.  Thanks to Bert for allowing me access to a device
	  for testing.
	- RFXCom: Improved handling of duplicate messages in RFXCom receiver
	  code.
	- Support for MacOS/X and FreeBSD
	- Rewrite of X10 encoding/decoding and added tests to cover this
	  code.
	- Allow overriding of the default time zone using the TZ
	  environment variable.  Thanks to Eric-jan Riemers for bug
	  reporting and testing.
	- Allow clients to register callbacks for xPL messages using filters
	  defined using code references rather than simply regular expressions.
	- Improved test coverage.
	- Improved support for security.zone messages.
	- Improved behaviour when using a loopback interface.
	- Minor fix to hddtemp output parsing/reporting.
	- Minor bug fixes to xPL::SQL - thanks to Eric for the bug
	  reports.  It might be worth noting that I don't actually
	  use this code.

	- BIG CHANGE: Message schema are now encoded as YAML datafiles and
	  not as Perl modules.  The YAML module is now required.  It is
	  avaliable as a Debian package called libyaml-perl and (probably)
	  an RPM package called perl-YAML.
	- New tool: xpl-rrd-graphs to convert rrd files as produced by
	  xpl-rrd into graphs under /var/www/rrd.
	- New *experimental* tool: xpl-perl-setup to setup the xPL-Perl
	  clients Feedback on this would be *very* useful.
	- New client: xpl-rfxcom to decode messages from RFXCOM receivers.
	- New client: xpl-csoft-sms: SMS sending client using the service
	  at: http://www.csoft.co.uk/
	- New client: xpl-monitor - a graphical debug tool - not complete
	- Mew tool: xpl-packet-trace - a TCP packet decoding tool for xPL
	  messages
	- xPL::Client: Support for hbeat.request messages.
	- xpl-sender: Support for waiting for responses.  Useful for
	  things like "xpl-sender -w 10 -c hbeat.request".
	- xpl-w800: added support for some X10 security sensors.
	- xPL::Message: improved support for duplicate fields in body of
	  messages
	- xPL::Message: allow empty message body
	- xpl-mplayer: Multiple playlist support - send two play command
	  messages quickly to rotate to next playlist.
	- xpl-x10: added extended function support.
	- xpl-x10: support for recent heyu-2.0beta releases
	- xpl-sql: fixes to the documentation - Thanks to Erik for the bug
	  report.
	- New schema: datetime.basic, dawndusk.request, hbeat.request,
	  sendmsg.basic, x10.security
	- Lots of performance improvements to the code used for xPL
	  messages.

        - Implemented lazy parsing of xPL message header and body to
            give 400% speedup for hubs (which ignore everything but
            the hop count) and significant improvement to typical clients.
        - New client: xpl-dmx
            Interface to the 512 Channel Serial to DMX transmitter
            from Milford Instruments http://www.milinst.com/
        - New client: xpl-lirc (for LIRC infrared interface)
        - New client: xpl-xvkbd (to sending keystrokes to X11 applications)
        - New client: xpl-mplayer (mplayer interface for playing music)
        - New message types: remote.basic and dmx.basic.
        - Minor updates to reflect control.basic and sensor.basic schema
            changes.
        - Added support for xPL::Timer::Recurrence wrapper around
            DateTime::Event::Recurrence as an alternative to the Cron-style
            which seems to have an infinite loop bug inheritted from
            DateTime::Event::Cron.
	- Updated xpl-owfs for 1-wire interface to support humidity
            sensors and relay outputs.
        - Fixed a bugs and unhelpful error messages relating to the
            default instance id.  Thanks to Andy on the xPL list.
        - Fixed a few problems with SKIP blocks in tests.  (Thanks to
            Andy again.)
        - Fixed a problem with the interfaces test.  (Thanks to Andy.)

        - Fixed problem with logger only logging its own messages.
        - Fixed SYNOPSIS to use new syntax - thanks to rleong1.
        - New xPL::Timer abstraction - crontab-based timer syntax
          changed from "C * * * * *" to "cron crontab='* * * * *'"
          to give more flexibility.
        - New client: xpl-dawndusk
        - New client: xpl-dg834 (for monitoring my adsl link)
        - New client: xpl-digitemp (1-wire client)
        - New client: xpl-hddtemp
        - New client: xpl-owfs (1-wire client - less stable than xpl-digitemp)
        - New client: xpl-rrd
        - New client: xpl-sql-logger (in progress - api/table changes likely)
        - New client: xpl-viom
        - New client: xpl-w800
        - New message types: cid.basic, tts.basic, dawndusk.basic,
                             sensor.basic, control.basic
        - Bug: closed filehandles were not removed properly

        - Some API changes:
          * 'xpl-*' - '-i' now specifies and interface.
          * 'xpl-sender' - message type is now the '-m' option.
