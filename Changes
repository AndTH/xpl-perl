0.03  Sat May 27 12:00:00 BST 2006
        - Fixed problem with logger only logging its own messages.
        - Fixed SYNOPSIS to use new syntax - thanks to rleong1.
        - New xPL::Timer abstraction - crontab-based timer syntax
          changed from "C * * * * *" to "cron crontab='* * * * *'"
          to give more flexibility.
        - New client: xpl-dawndusk
        - New client: xpl-dg834 (for monitoring my adsl link)
        - New client: xpl-digitemp (1-wire client)
        - New client: xpl-hddtemp
        - New client: xpl-owfs (1-wire client - less stable than xpl-digitemp)
        - New client: xpl-rrd
        - New client: xpl-sql-logger (in progress - api/table changes likely)
        - New client: xpl-viom
        - New client: xpl-w800
        - New message types: cid.basic, tts.basic, dawndusk.basic,
                             sensor.basic, control.basic
        - Bug: closed filehandles were not removed properly
