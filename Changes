Revision history for Perl extension xPL.

0.04  Sat Mar  3 19:00:00 GMT 2007
        - Implemented lazy parsing of xPL message header and body to
            give 400% speedup for hubs (which ignore everything but
            the hop count) and significant improvement to typical clients.
        - New client: xpl-dmx
            Interface to the 512 Channel Serial to DMX transmitter
            from Milford Instruments http://www.milinst.com/
        - New client: xpl-lirc (for LIRC infrared interface)
        - New client: xpl-xvkbd (to sending keystrokes to X11 applications)
        - New client: xpl-mplayer (mplayer interface for playing music)
        - New message types: remote.basic and dmx.basic.
        - Minor updates to reflect control.basic and sensor.basic schema
            changes.
        - Added support for xPL::Timer::Recurrence wrapper around
            DateTime::Event::Recurrence as an alternative to the Cron-style
            which seems to have an infinite loop bug inheritted from
            DateTime::Event::Cron.
	- Updated xpl-owfs for 1-wire interface to support humidity
            sensors and relay outputs.
        - Fixed a bugs and unhelpful error messages relating to the
            default instance id.  Thanks to Andy on the xPL list.
        - Fixed a few problems with SKIP blocks in tests.  (Thanks to
            Andy again.)
        - Fixed a problem with the interfaces test.  (Thanks to Andy.)

        - Fixed problem with logger only logging its own messages.
        - Fixed SYNOPSIS to use new syntax - thanks to rleong1.
        - New xPL::Timer abstraction - crontab-based timer syntax
          changed from "C * * * * *" to "cron crontab='* * * * *'"
          to give more flexibility.
        - New client: xpl-dawndusk
        - New client: xpl-dg834 (for monitoring my adsl link)
        - New client: xpl-digitemp (1-wire client)
        - New client: xpl-hddtemp
        - New client: xpl-owfs (1-wire client - less stable than xpl-digitemp)
        - New client: xpl-rrd
        - New client: xpl-sql-logger (in progress - api/table changes likely)
        - New client: xpl-viom
        - New client: xpl-w800
        - New message types: cid.basic, tts.basic, dawndusk.basic,
                             sensor.basic, control.basic
        - Bug: closed filehandles were not removed properly

        - Some API changes:
