xPL version 0.01
================

These modules are intended to provide a framework for writing xPL
applications (see http://wiki.xplproject.org.uk/) in Perl.  A number
of sample applications are also provided including a hub, a logging
client, a bridge and a command line message sender.

In order to ensure that the applications stay running,  I run
the applications using Dan Bernstein's "daemontools" from:

  http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html

You could also use runit (http://smarden.org/runit/) or just
using wrappers and /etc/inittab.

When looking at the code, particularly the code for the message
schemas, you will notice that there isn't much of it.  This is
intentional.  I don't generally like writing the same code more than
once and would rather get Perl to generate it.  Also, I'd like
eventually to parse a schema definition directly to generate the
classes representing that message schema.

This is an early release of the API and it likely that it will still
change a little over the next few weeks and months.

At the moment, I'm in the process of converting a number of existing
applications - currently using Jabber for messaging - to use these
modules.  I'm sure I'll find a few issues with the API as I continue
this process.  The working applications I am porting interface with a
CM11 X10 controller, a VIOM IO controller, a Milford DMX transmitter,
a 1-wire network of temperature sensors, a caller id application
utilising an old USR modem and an APC ups.  I also have a simple web
interface (using CGI::Ajax and some of the more subtle
http://script.aculo.us/ effects) and a Jabber interface so I can chat
to my house.  I have some code that provides a simple engine to
process rules for timers, message-based triggers and simple scenes.
Hopefully, I will port these in the next month or two and then I can
get back to the job of improving them.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

(Note, there are a couple of timing issues that occasionally cause
a few tests to fail.  Try repeating the tests if you get failures.)


DEPENDENCIES

Most of the required modules are distributed with recent versions
of Perl.  Currently the only exception is the X::Osd module which
is used by the xpl-xosd sample client which is not essential to
the use of the libraries themselves.
