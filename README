xPL version 0.11
================

These modules are intended to provide a framework for writing xPL
applications (see http://wiki.xplproject.org.uk/) in Perl.  A number
of sample applications are also provided including a hub, a logging
client, a bridge and a command line message sender.

In order to ensure that the applications stay running,  I run
the applications using Dan Bernstein's "daemontools" from:

  http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html

You could also use runit (http://smarden.org/runit/) or just
using wrappers and /etc/inittab.

When looking at the code, particularly the code for the message
schemas, you will notice that there isn't much of it.  This is
intentional.  I don't generally like writing the same code more than
once and would rather get Perl to generate it.  Also, I'd like
eventually to parse a schema definition directly to generate the
classes representing that message schema.

This is an early release of the API and it likely that it will still
change a little over the next few weeks and months.

Example xPL clients are provided for:

  X10 using heyu (http://www.heyu.org/),
  Phaedrus VIOM IO controllers,
  Milford DMX transmitters,
  1-wire,
  EasyDAQ USB relay controllers,
  Dawn and Dusk,
  CTX35,
  Current Cost Energy Meters,
  Free Desktop (D-Bus) Notifications,
  LIRC,
  RFXCOM RF transmitters and receivers,
  W800 RF receivers,
  sending SMS messages,
  UDIN USB relay controllers,
  X11 On-screen display nofitications,
  Wake-on LAN,
  X11 virtual keyboard for faking key presses,
  and more
  

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

(Note, there are a couple of timing issues that occasionally cause
a few tests to fail.  Try repeating the tests if you get failures.)


DEPENDENCIES

Most of the required modules are distributed with recent versions
of Perl.  Some of the more elaborate clients require additional
modules from CPAN.


DEBIAN PACKAGES

The repository at http://debian.temporalanomaly.com/ contains
Debian packages for xPL Perl.
