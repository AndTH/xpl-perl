=head1 NAME

xpl-udin - Perl script for an xPL Audon UDIN USB Relay client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  xpl-udin [flags] [options] --udin-tty <device>
  where valid flags are:
    --help         - show this help text
    --verbose      - verbose mode (for the xPL layer)
    --udin-verbose - verbose mode (for the UDIN layer)
  and valid options are (default shown in brackets):
    --interface if0      - the interface for xPL messages (first
                           non-loopback or loopback)
    --udin-baud baud     - the baud rate (9600)
    --udin-tty <device>  - the ttyUSB device for the UDIN module

  # start the UDIN application on first ethernet interface in verbose mode
  xpl-udin --interface eth0 --verbose --udin-verbose --udin-tty /dev/ttyUSB6

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an xPL client that interfaces with a UDIN USB Relay
device.  It supports the use of control.basic messages with current
fields set to 'high', 'low', or 'pulse' with devices of the form 'oNN'
where NN is a number from 1 to 16.  There is no support for UDIN
inputs.

This script may also work with other Audon devices which have similar
firmware.  For this reason, control.basic current=pulse messages are
handled in the manner expected by an SPO-RL8 Serial Relay device even
though these will be ignored by a UDIN USB device.
