libxpl-perl (0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lots of refactoring:
    - Removed approximately 1/5th of the code.
    - Moved code from scripts (w/ 0% test coverage) to modules
      (99.6% test coverage) which should make things easier to
      maintain.  Script directory now has 28% of the total
      codebase rather than 67% as in previous release.
  * New helper modules:
    - xPL::IOHandler - generic handler writing common record
      types to serial or socket-based devices.  Handles queuing
      writes and encoding/decoding of outgoing/incoming
      messages.
    - xPL::Dock - support clients as "plugins".  Most existing
      clients have been converted to this form and one client
      xpl-rfxcom has been created as an example of how to use
      two plugins (RFXComRX and RFXComTX) in one client.  This
      is intended to help developers wanting to write a single
      "embedded-style" client with support for multiple devices.
      A side-effect of this is that much more code is now in
      modules and not scripts so much more code can be tested
      effectively.
  * New client: xpl-mythtv - monitor utilisation of tuners on a
    mythtv backend
  * New client: xpl-easydaq - for EasyDAQ usb relay modules from
    http://www.easydaq.biz
  * New client: xpl-bluetooth - for simple bluetooth proximity
  * New client: xpl-linux - for monitoring linux health (mostly
    laptops since my house now runs on a Samsung NC10).
  * New client: xpl-apcupsd - for monitor a UPS using the apcups
    daemon, http://www.apcupsd.com/
  * Renamed client: xpl-rfxcom w/device id rfxcom to
    xpl-rfxcom-rx/rfxcomrx.
  * Renamed client: xpl-rfxcom-trans w/id rfxcomt to
    xpl-rfxcom-tx/rfxcomtx.
  * Renamed client: xpl-x10 to xpl-heyu with corresponding
    device id change.
  * xpl-heyu: support for new "heyu monitor" output format.
  * xpl-currentcost: support new CC128/Envi energy monitors.
  * xpl-rfxcom-tx: increased ack timeout as suggested by Bert.
  * xpl-rfxcom-rx: support for THN132N - thanks to roger78.
  * Lots of documentation updates.
  * Support of using YAML::Syck instead of YAML for schema
    parsing for faster startup of clients.
  * xPL::Message 20% speedup on 10k message benchmark
  * xPL::Message lazy instantiation of schema classes - speedup
    of 10% for xpl-sender using only 1 schema class.
  * xpl-perl-setup several fixes suggested by Clarke Brunt.
  * All clients: Support hubless mode (using SO_REUSEADDR) for
    use on devices like the NSLU2 when only xPL-Perl is being
    used.

libxpl-perl (0.09-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New client: xpl-udin for a Audon UDIN usb relay device.
  * New client: xpl-currentcost for a Current Cost energy meter.
  * All clients: "kill -USR1 <pid>" dumps some statistics about
    time spent in callbacks.
  * xpl-viom: Add initialisation to script.  Thanks to Boyd Hitchcock
    for reminding me.
  * xPL::Timer::{sunrise,sunset} support time zone correctly.
  * xPL::Message: minor speed up to message_type validation.
  * Fixed instance_id length in xPL::Client.  No idea why this
    was wrong here but not in xPL::Message.  Thanks to Francois
    Corthay for spotting this.
  * xpl-dmx: Added support for vendor specific 'fade=[seconds]'
    field.
  * xpl-lcdproc: Missing in manifest.  Oops.
  * xpl-clock: Minor command line option fixes.  Thanks to Francois
    Corthay.
  * DEPRECATED: xpl-csoft-sms, xpl-digitemp, xpl-mplayer,
    xpl-sql-logger and xPL::SQL have been removed.

libxpl-perl (0.08-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * xpl-lcdproc: New client to display osd.basic messages on an LCD that
    is supported by LCDProc. See http://lcdproc.sf.net/.
  * xpl-ctx35: Fix bug in extended function handling.  Thanks to Jeroen
    Hendriks for the patch.
  * xpl-mpd: Simple media.basic client for the music player daemon from
    http://www.musicpd.org/
  * xpl-rfxcom, xpl-rfxcom-trans: Support for homeeasy.basic.
  * xpl-rfxcom: Support for RFXSensor informational/diagnostic
    messages.
  * xpl-rfxcom: Support for X10 KR21 security keyfobs.
  * xpl-rfxcom: Support all three sensors of electrisave/owl devices.
    Thanks to DavidMbrookE for doing the hard part.
  * xpl-rfxcom: Improved RTGR328N date/time support.
  * xpl-rfxcom: THGR328N support.
  * xpl-rfxcom: Attempt at Oregon Scientific GR101 scales support.
  * Lots of improvements to developer documentation.
  * DEPRECATED: xpl-csoft-sms, xpl-digitemp, xpl-mplayer, xpl-sql-logger and

libxpl-perl (0.07-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * All clients are converted to use Getopt::Long and now support
    passing arbitrary parameters to the xPL::Client constructor using
    '--define key=value' options on the command line.
  * xpl-perl-setup script should now do something reasonable
    on Fedora/RedHat.
  * xpl-dmx - added support for dmx.confirm messages and provide
    a default colour set in case /etc/X11/rgb.txt does not exist.
    Thanks to DesG.
  * xpl-rfxcom: Added support for BTHR918, BWR102 and THGR810.
  * xpl-rfxcom: Generate sensor.basic type=battery messages.  Devices
    supporting only a low battery flag just send a value of 90%
    normally and 10% if the low flag is set.  (osd.basic messages
    are no longer generated.)
  * xpl-rfxcom: Improve parsing of received messages (10 times faster).
  * xpl-rfxcom: Improved test coverage for Oregon devices.
  * xpl-x10 - send confirms for all heyu initiated messages not
    just those generated by xpl-x10 itself.
  * xpl-x10 - fix unit addressing to recognise when multiple units
    have been addressed at once.
  * xpl-x10 client now forks a helper program so that calls to
    'heyu' are made asynchronously.
  * xpl-x10 more efficient addressing.  An x10.basic message
    with device=i4,i6,i8,i10 is passed to heyu as 'i4,6,8,10'
    rather than four separate calls.  This makes this client
    much more efficient/responsive.
  * xPL::Message doesn't corrupt argments passed to the constructor.
  * All clients now use POD::Usage so usage text and manual pages
    share the same text rather than having (inaccurate) duplication.
  * Simple queue abstraction added, xPL::Queue.  Used by xpl-x10,
    xpl-rfxcom-trans, xpl-dmx, xpl-viom, etc.

  * New client: xpl-ctx35 experimental (transmit only) support for
    CTX35/TI103/TI203/TI213 X10 Transceiver.  Thanks to Eric-jan Riemers
    for testing.
  * New client: xpl-sms-send.  More generic SMS sending using SMS::Send
    drivers from CPAN.
  * Added to SMS::Send drivers one for CSoft (tested) and one for
    SMSDiscount (untested since I don't have an account) both of these
    will probably move to CPAN.
  * New script: xpl-tty-tcp make a serial/USB device available on a TCP
    port.  Allows multiple clients to connect at once though I don't
    recemmend it.  It is primarily intended to allow me to emulate a
    networked RFXCom transmitter/receiver for testing purposes.
  * RFXCom: Experimental transmitter support.
  * RFXCom: Several improvements to the receiver client.  Thanks to Bert
    for his comments on the xpl-dev@xpl-home.org list on Wed, 04 Jul 2007
    12:30:53 -0400.
  * RFXCom: RFXSensor negative temperature support (untested).
  * RFXCom: Oregon THWR288A support.  Thanks to Eric-jan Riemers for test
    data and testing.
  * RFXMeter/RFXPower: Bug fixing.  Thanks to Rick Klaassen.
  * RFXCom: Support for WGR918.  Thanks to Rick Klaassen for test data,
    testing and bug fixing.
  * RFXCom: Visonic PowerCode and CodeSecure devices.  I'd still like to
    implemente parity (or similar) checking for CodeSecure device if such
    a thing is possible.
  * RFXCom: Support for networked (as well as USB) receivers and
    transmitters.  Thanks to Bert for allowing me access to a device for
    testing.
  * RFXCom: Improved handling of duplicate messages in RFXCom receiver code.
  * Support for MacOS/X and FreeBSD
  * Rewrite of X10 encoding/decoding and added tests to cover this code.
  * Allow overriding of the default time zone using the TZ environment
    variable.  Thanks to Eric-jan Riemers for bug reporting and testing.
  * Allow clients to register callbacks for xPL messages using filters
    defined using code references rather than simply regular expressions.
  * Improved test coverage.
  * Improved support for security.zone messages.
  * Improved behaviour when using a loopback interface.
  * Minor fix to hddtemp output parsing/reporting.
  * Minor bug fixes to xPL::SQL - thanks to Eric for the bug reports.  It
    might be worth noting that I don't actually use this code.

libxpl-perl (0.05-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * BIG CHANGE: Message schema are now encoded as YAML datafiles and
    not as Perl modules.  The YAML module is now required.  It is
    avaliable as a Debian package called libyaml-perl and (probably)
    an RPM package called perl-YAML.
  * New tool: xpl-rrd-graphs to convert rrd files as produced by xpl-rrd
    into graphs under /var/www/rrd.
  * New *experimental* tool: xpl-perl-setup to setup the xPL-Perl clients
    Feedback on this would be *very* useful.
  * New client: xpl-rfxcom to decode messages from RFXCOM receivers.
  * New client: xpl-csoft-sms: SMS sending client using the service at:
    http://www.csoft.co.uk/
  * New client: xpl-monitor - a graphical debug tool - not complete
  * Mew tool: xpl-packet-trace - a TCP packet decoding tool for xPL messages
  * xPL::Client: Support for hbeat.request messages.
  * xpl-sender: Support for waiting for responses.  Useful for things
    like "xpl-sender -w 10 -c hbeat.request".
  * xpl-w800: added support for some X10 security sensors.
  * xPL::Message: improved support for duplicate fields in body of messages
  * xPL::Message: allow empty message body
  * xpl-mplayer: Multiple playlist support - send two play command messages
    quickly to rotate to next playlist.
  * xpl-x10: added extended function support.
  * xpl-x10: support for recent heyu-2.0beta releases
  * xpl-sql: fixes to the documentation - Thanks to Erik for the bug report.
  * New schema: datetime.basic, dawndusk.request, hbeat.request,
    sendmsg.basic, x10.security
  * Lots of performance improvements to the code used for xPL messages.

libxpl-perl (0.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented lazy parsing of xPL message header and body to
    give 400% speedup for hubs (which ignore everything but
    the hop count) and significant improvement to typical clients.
  * New client: xpl-dmx Interface to the 512 Channel Serial to DMX transmitter
    from Milford Instruments http://www.milinst.com/

    DateTime::Event::Recurrence as an alternative to the Cron-style which
    seems to have an infinite loop bug inheritted from DateTime::Event::Cron.
  * Updated xpl-owfs for 1-wire interface to support humidity sensors and
    relay outputs.
  * Fixed a bugs and unhelpful error messages relating to the default
    instance id.  Thanks to Andy on the xPL list.
