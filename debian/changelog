libxpl-perl (0.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented lazy parsing of xPL message header and body to
    give 400% speedup for hubs (which ignore everything but
    the hop count) and significant improvement to typical clients.
  * New client: xpl-dmx Interface to the 512 Channel Serial to DMX transmitter
    from Milford Instruments http://www.milinst.com/
  * New client: xpl-lirc (for LIRC infrared interface)
  * New client: xpl-xvkbd (to sending keystrokes to X11 applications)
  * New client: xpl-mplayer (mplayer interface for playing music)
  * New message types: remote.basic and dmx.basic.
  * Minor updates to reflect control.basic and sensor.basic schema changes.
  * Added support for xPL::Timer::Recurrence wrapper around
    DateTime::Event::Recurrence as an alternative to the Cron-style which
    seems to have an infinite loop bug inheritted from DateTime::Event::Cron.
  * Updated xpl-owfs for 1-wire interface to support humidity sensors and
    relay outputs.
  * Fixed a bugs and unhelpful error messages relating to the default
    instance id.  Thanks to Andy on the xPL list.
