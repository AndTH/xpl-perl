libxpl-perl (0.03-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed problem with logger only logging its own messages.
  * Fixed SYNOPSIS to use new syntax - thanks to rleong1.
  * New xPL::Timer abstraction - crontab-based timer syntax
    changed from "C * * * * *" to "cron crontab='* * * * *'"
    to give more flexibility.
  * New client: xpl-dawndusk
  * New client: xpl-dg834 (for monitoring my adsl link)
  * New client: xpl-digitemp (1-wire client)
  * New client: xpl-hddtemp
  * New client: xpl-owfs (1-wire client - less stable than xpl-digitemp)
  * New client: xpl-rrd
  * New client: xpl-sql-logger (in progress - api/table changes likely)
  * New client: xpl-viom
  * New client: xpl-w800
  * New message types: cid.basic, tts.basic, dawndusk.basic,
                       sensor.basic, control.basic
  * Bug: closed filehandles were not removed properly
