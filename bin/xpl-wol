=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an xPL client that sends WOL messages using the command
C<sudo etherwake &lt;macaddress&gt;>.  This script requires:

=item the etherwake command

Most Linux distributions will probably provide a package for this.

=item the sudo command

Most Linux distributions will probably provide a package for this.  It
must be configured to allow the user running the client to execute
the C<etherwake> command.  Typically, something like:

  xplperl ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/etherwake
