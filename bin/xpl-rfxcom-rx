=head1 NAME

xpl-rfxcom-rx - Perl script for an xPL RFXCOM RF receiver application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  xpl-rfxcom-rx [flags] [options] --rfxcom-rx <device>
  where valid flags are:
    -h - show this help text
    -v - verbose mode
  and valid options are (default shown in brackets):
    -i if0  - the interface for xPL messages (first non-loopback or loopback)
    -B baud - the baud rate (4800)

  # start the rfxcom-rx application on first ethernet interface in verbose mode
  xpl-rfxcom-rx -i eth0 -v --rfxcom-rx <device>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an xPL client that interfaces with an RFXCOM RF receiver.

=cut

use strict;
use warnings;
use xPL::Dock qw/RFXComRX/;
$|=1; # autoflush helps debugging
my $xpl = xPL::Dock->new;
$xpl->main_loop;

# send a 'hbeat.end' message on exit
END { defined $xpl && $xpl->send_hbeat_end(); }

=head1 BUGS

Not all devices supported by an RFXCOM receiver are currently
supported.  Support can usually be added quite easily if example data
can be provided - such as the output of the sample RFreceiver.exe.
