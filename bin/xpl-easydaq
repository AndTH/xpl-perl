=head1 NAME

xpl-easydaq - Perl script for an xPL EasyDAQ USB Relay client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  xpl-easydaq [flags] [options] --easydaq <device>
  where valid flags are:
    -h        - show this help text
    -v        - verbose mode
    --easydaq - the ttyUSB device for the relay module
  and valid options are (default shown in brackets):
    -i if0  - the interface for xPL messages (first non-loopback or loopback)
    -B baud - the baud rate (9600)

  # start the easydaq application on first ethernet interface in verbose mode
  xpl-easydaq -i eth0 -v --easydaq /dev/ttyUSB6

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an xPL client that interfaces with a EasyDAQ USB Relay
device.  It supports the use of control.basic messages with current
fields set to 'high', 'low', or 'pulse' with devices of the form 'oNN'
where NN is a number from 1 to 16.  There is no support for EasyDAQ
inputs.

This script may also work with other Audon devices which have similar
firmware.  For this reason, control.basic current=pulse messages are
handled in the manner expected by an SPO-RL8 Serial Relay device even
though these will be ignored by a EasyDAQ USB device.
