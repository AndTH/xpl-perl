=head1 NAME

xpl-easydaq - Perl script for an xPL EasyDAQ USB Relay client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  xpl-easydaq [flags] [options] <device>
  where valid flags are:
    --help            - show this help text
    --verbose         - verbose mode (for the xPL layer)
    --easydaq-verbose - verbose mode (for the easydaq layer)
  and valid options are (default shown in brackets):
    --interface if0        - the interface for xPL messages (first
                             non-loopback or loopback)
    --easydaq-baud nnnn    - the baud rate (9600)
    --easydaq-tty /dev/xxx - the USB/serial device

  # start the easydaq application on first ethernet interface in verbose mode
  xpl-easydaq --interface eth0 --verbose \
              --easydaq-verbose --easydaq-tty /dev/ttyUSB6

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an xPL client that interfaces with a EasyDAQ USB Relay
device.  It supports the use of control.basic messages with current
fields set to 'high', 'low', or 'pulse' with devices of the form 'oNN'
where NN is a number from 1 to 16.  There is no support for EasyDAQ
inputs.

This script may also work with other Audon devices which have similar
firmware.  For this reason, control.basic current=pulse messages are
handled in the manner expected by an SPO-RL8 Serial Relay device even
though these will be ignored by a EasyDAQ USB device.
